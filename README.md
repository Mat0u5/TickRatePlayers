This simple mod allows players to tick (so move, jump, attack, take damage) faster when using the vanilla tick rate command, just like other entities.<br>
Because in vanilla, the player can only get slowed down by the tick rate command, not sped up.

This mod also speeds up all sounds or slows them down based on the tick rate.
